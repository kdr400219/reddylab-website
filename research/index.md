# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

We are committed to open, ethical science. Once ready for primetime, all research led by the lab will be first posted as preprints (read [Plan U](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000273)). We will link all source data on this page - if we miss something, let us know!

# Structure-Function, Evolution, and Engineering of Membrane Transport

{% include section.html %}

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Cells require membrane transporters to perform continuous, selective movement of molecules across their membranes; this ‘out-of-equilibrium’ state maintains the homeostasis of various organic and inorganic substrates critical to life, including ions, nutrients, lipids, drugs, and numerous other signaling molecules. Transporters are intricate molecular machines with incredible functional diversity and plasticity, enabling cells to adapt to complex and ever-changing environments. We want to understand how these machines work.

**Our ultimate goal is to be able to precisely control how transporters work, through either protein engineering or pharmacology.** We use a combination of bioinformatics, genomics, biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology to understand the mechanics of membrane transport.
